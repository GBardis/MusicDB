93	\N	Saxophone player, son of [a1215297]\r\n\r\nOnce described as one of the London jazz scene’s best-kept secrets, Ray Carless is a tenor soprano saxophonist who has been creating groovy, melodic music with the great and the good for four decades.\r\nHe was part of the original ‘Brit funk’ movement and a founding member of London’s best jazz funk outfit Incognito.

196	\N	Marty Friedman has sold over 10 million albums with the multi-platinum band Megadeth. He has also a dedicated following for his own solo albums which stylistically range from orchestral soundtrack style music to furious aggressive rock, with the common thread being Marty`s unique and tasty sense of melody. His latest album is called `Music For Speeding` and it marks his solo debut with the heavy hitting major label Universal Japan as well as Steve Vai`s Favored Nations label in the US. Marty has toured the world several times over very successfully withMegadeth. Along with touring, he is in high demand to do music/guitar seminars and clinics all over the U.S., Asia, Europe and South America, which he has done hundreds to date. Marty is also a regular columnist for Guitar World magazine, Young Guitar magazine (Japan) and Burrn Magazine in which he writes a column in Japanese, a reader favorite. Marty has designed his own signature model guitar with Jackson Guitars (the KE-1) that has been selling consistently since it was put on the market. He has just begun an endorsement relationship with Ibanez. His new 'Marty Friedman model' guitar will make its world debut in Oct '05 at the Tokyo Music Show. Along with doing his solo performances around the world, Marty is currently touring and recording with Japanese mega-star Aikawa Nanase.\r\n\r\nBefore joining Megadeth in Feb.1990, Marty was in a band called Cacophony, which released 2 albums (among their indie label's highest selling) and toured the U.S. and Japan. This band highlighted the potent guitar playing of Marty and fellow guitarist Jason Becker (who was to join David Lee Roth's band and record an album with him in 1990). Marty has received extremely high acclaim and many awards around the world for his unmistakably `Marty-esque` way of playing the guitar.\r\n\r\nMarty is from Washington D.C. originally but has lived in many places including Hawaii, Germany and California, giving him an odd and interesting approach to making his music. He currently resides in Tokyo\r\n	2017-11-23 18:56:04.430067	2017-11-25 23:59:39.0794	8	Marty Friedman

434	\N	Swedish singer, and songwriter who is well known as one of the lead singers of Swedish pop group [a69866]. \r\nBorn on November 15, 1945 in Ballangen, Norway. \r\nFor more Anni-Frid Lyngstad releases, see the [a=Frida] page.\r\n\r\n[b]Anni-Frid Lyngstad[/b] started her music career in 1958 as a jazz singer. In the 1960s, she married jazz musician Ragnar Fredriksson and had two children, [a325133] and Ann Lise-Lotte Fredriksson. The couple separated after a few years. During Dagen-H in 1967, she won EMI's talent competition, "New Faces" and first appeared on Swedish television, as she sang "En ledig dag", which was her first single released by His Master's Voice, a week after Dagen-H. [b]Lyngstad[/b] was a struggling singer prior to the formation of ABBA due to her fourth placement in Melodifestivalen 1969, with a song "Härlig är vår jord". Nonetheless, [b]Lyngstad[/b] recorded singles for EMI consistently, which led her to appear on Swedish television and cabarets, despite that neither of the other songs, charted or only a few songs were circulated in the Swedish radio or sales charts, until she met future bandmate and husband [a69873] the same year, who would later propelled her to sing other genres beyond her jazz songs, with her first No. 1 hit in the Swedish radio charts, "Min egen stad", released in 1971 as the B-side to "En gång är ingen gång".\r\n\r\nA year later, in 1972, [b]Lyngstad[/b] was signed to [l40813] and recorded her first single for the label "Man vill ju leva lite dessemellan", which was her second No. 1 hit in Svensktoppen; ABBA would be formed that same year. During ABBA's recording session of "Waterloo" and their early success after winning the Eurovision Song Contest of 1974, the production of her first solo album for Polar, "Frida Ensam" commenced and took one and a quarter year to finish the recording of the album. "Frida Ensam" was released in November 1975 in Scandinavia. Her single, Fernando (later recorded in English by ABBA), and the album reached to the top 10 in Svensktoppen. \r\n\r\nDuring ABBA's middle to final years, [b]Lyngstad[/b] married Andersson in 1978, and later divorced him in 1981, due to multiple disputes. This led her to collaborate with Genesis drummer and singer [a101028] with her famous album, "Something's Going On", in 1982. With her single, "I Know There's Something Going On", the single reached to the top fives in most of Europe's weekly charts, while in some countries such as the United Kingdom, and the United States, it reached lower than the top fives, depending on the quantity of the record chart list, most notably No. 13 on Billboard's Hot 100. "Something's Going On", as an album, reached to one of the top 40 in Europe's country-varied weekly charts, while in the United States, it reached No. 41 in Billboard's 200. Other singles from "Something's Going On" followed, but did not match the success as her lead single did.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, [b]Lyngstad[/b] released her album "Shine", produced by [a50809]. Unlike her previous album, it was a moderate success in Europe, reaching the Top 10, and Top 20 on some countries such as Sweden, Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands, but not in particular countries, especially the United Kingdom, which reached No. 67. The album, "Shine", also debuted her songwriting such as "Don't Do It", "I Don't Wanna Be Alone" (unreleased, exists only as a bootleg), and "That's Tough" (non-album track), and spawned singles, "Shine/That's Tough", "Come To Me (I Am Woman)/Slowly", "Heart of the Country/Slowly", and "Twist in the Dark/Come To Me (I Am Woman)". She withdrew from music business for a while, as a solo singer after "Shine" was released.\r\n\r\nA few years later, starting in 1991, [b]Lyngstad[/b] became an environmentalist, appearing on fairs and galas, and formed a short lived supergroup, "Artister för Miljö", to raise awareness of the environment. Five years later, she marked her music comeback with her album "Djupa andetag". The album featured her singles, "Även en blomma", "Ögonen", and "Alla mina bästa år", as well as her self-composed album track, "Kvinnor som springer". [b]Lyngstad[/b] became a princess through her marriage to Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss (of Plauen) in 1992. The marriage lasted until Reuss died of lymphoma in 1999. \r\n\r\nSince 1987, [b]Lyngstad[/b] has appeared as a guest singer, most notably with Swedish duo [a51226], Deep Purple keyboardist [a262410], and [a2553309].\r\n[b]Lyngstad[/b] was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of ABBA in 2010.\r\n\r\n	2017-11-23 19:05:12.37767	2017-11-26 00:27:34.079739	17	Anni-Frid Lyngstad

454	\N	Carl Wilson (born December 21, 1946, Hawthorne, California, USA – died February 6, 1998, Los Angeles, California, USA) was an American rock and roll singer and guitarist, best known as a founding member, lead guitarist and sometime lead vocalist of [a70829]. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. He was the youngest brother of fellow band members [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/189718-Brian-Wilson]Brian[/url] and [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/391245-Dennis-Wilson-2]Dennis[/url], and cousin of [a372789]. Son of [a363017] and [a3239364]. Uncle of [a434651] and [a413862].\r\n\r\nLike most members of The Beach Boys, Carl was a multi-instrumentalist, playing lead, rhythm, bass, and acoustic guitars, keyboards, and occasionally drums onstage.\r\n\r\nAfter his elder brother Brian's retirement from the stage in 1965, Carl became the de facto leader of the band onstage, and shortly after became the band's in-studio leader, producing the bulk of the 1967-1973 albums "Smiley Smile, Friends", "20/20", "Wild Honey", "Surf's Up", [a2415580] - "So Tough", and "Holland".\r\n\r\nCarl's leadership role in the band diminished somewhat in the late 1970's, both due to Brian's brief re-emergence as the band's producer and Carl's own substance abuse problems. He nonetheless remained a prominent and recognizable voice in the band, taking lead vocals on many songs and serving as "mixdown producer" on the Brian-produced "Love You" album. By the time of recording of 1979's "L.A. (Light Album)", Carl again found himself filling the vocal and songwriting gap left by a retreating Brian Wilson.\r\n\r\nAs a lead vocalist Carl was the last member of the group to be assigned lead vocals to sing.  His first turn at the solo mic was on 1964's "Pom-Pom Playgirl", from "Shut Down Vol. 2".  Over the years he has been considered one of the greatest singers in pop/rock, deftly handling ballads such as "God Only Knows", pop gems like "I Can Hear Music", and rock and rollers including "Darlin'" and "Keeping The Summer Alive".  On tour, particularly in the late 1960's and 1970's, his extraordinary voice often replaced that of his brother Brian's on songs originally sung by the latter, including "Don't Worry Baby", "Surfer Girl", and "Let The Wind Blow".\r\n\r\nCarl was not the most controversial member of the band.  To his credit, his quiet, private life endured only two ripples: first, in the late 1960's, he emerged victorious from a fight with the US government over his Conscientious Objector status regarding the Vietnam draft (he and the band agreed to play a number of free benefit concerts in lieu of Carl being drafted); second, in the late 1970's he appeared on a television simulcast concert in Australia with The Beach Boys while inebriated (he later explained it away as a reaction to flu medicine).  \r\n\r\nBy the early 1980's The Beach Boys were in disarray. Frustrated with the band's sluggishness to record new material and reluctance to rehearse for live shows, Carl Wilson took a leave of absence in 1981, rather than remain as part of what he saw increasingly becoming a nostalgia act. Thence, he released a 1981 solo album, "Carl Wilson", to little critical notice, with songs co-written with [a360015] - particularly the extraordinary "Heaven" and the radio hit "Hurry Love". He recorded a second solo album, 1983's "Youngblood", in a similar vein, but by the time it was released he had already rejoined The Beach Boys. Although "Youngblood" did not chart, a single, the [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/987261-John-Joseph-Hall]John Hall[/url] and [a604946] penned "What You Do To Me," did, and it took on new meaning after the death of brother Dennis in December 1983. Youngblood also featured a cover of [a260458]'s "Rockin' All Over The World", which he performed on tour with The Beach Boys in the 1980's.\r\n\r\nDuring his brother Brian's mental health struggles and in-and-out participation in the band in the 1980's, particularly after the death of brother Dennis, Carl was closely involved in the legal and moral support of Brian, and was a key player in supporting Brian's second wife Melinda in the ousting of controversial psychologist [a1057138] from Brian's affairs.\r\n\r\nCarl was diagnosed with brain and lung cancer in early 1997. Despite his illness and chemotherapy treatments, he continued to perform after diagnosis. Carl played through The Beach Boys' entire summer tour ending in the fall of 1997. Carl Wilson lost his battle with cancer on February 6, 1998, just two months after the death of his mother, Audree. He was survived by his brother Brian, wife Gina (daughter of [a10533]) and two sons Justyn and Jonah from his first marriage to Annie Hinsche (sister of [a299166] member, [a311944], who was a mainstay of the Beach Boys' support band on tour).\r\n\r\nA handful of additional recordings of Wilson have been released as the album "Like a Brother", by "supergroup" [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/274822-Gerry-Beckley]Beckley[/url]-[url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/529946-Robert-Lamm]Lamm[/url]-Wilson, comprising Carl Wilson, Gerry Beckley of [a249829] and Robert Lamm of [a114483].\r\n\r\n[a=Carl Wilson (2)] Jazz organist\r\n[a=Carl Wilson (3)] Technician from New Zealand\r\n[a=Carl Wilson (4)] Carl "Flat Top" Wilson - Bassist from the shellac era.\r\n[a=Carl Wilson (5)] Credited for liner notes\r\n[a=Carl Wilson (7)] Photographer\r\n	2017-11-23 19:05:49.373054	2017-11-26 00:29:55.083777	17	Carl Wilson

685	\N	American composer, lyricist, songwriter, guitarist, vocalist, bandleader, conductor, producer, filmmaker. \r\nBorn 21 December 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. \r\nDied 4 December 1993 in Los Angeles, California, USA. \r\n\r\n[b]Frank Vincent Zappa[/b] was of Italian origins, his grandfather having arrived in America from Partinico, Sicily. [b] Frank Zappa[/b] grew to be one of the most accomplished composers of the rock era, his music combining an understanding and appreciation for such contemporary classical figures as [b][a=Igor Stravinsky][/b], [b][a=Karlheinz Stockhausen][/b] and [b][a=Edgard Varèse][/b]. These influences, coupled with an affection for late '50s doo-wop, rock & roll and skillful guitar-heavy rock, dominated pop in the '70s. However, [b]Zappa[/b] was also a keen satirist, whose reserves of scorn and parody seemed bottomless and whose wicked sense of humor and absurdity continued to delight his numerous fans - even when his lyrics crossed the broadest bounds of taste.\r\n\r\n[b]Zappa[/b] was also a prolific record-maker in his time, astutely producing massive amounts of music on his own labels of [b][l=Bizarre Records], [l=Straight][/b] & [b][l=Barking Pumpkin Records][/b] and through distribution deals with [b][l=Rykodisc][/b] and [b][l=Rhino Entertainment Company][/b]. This after long unhappy associations with industry giants like [b][l=Warner Bros. Records][/b] and the now-defunct [b][l=MGM][/b]. In the '80s, [b]Zappa[/b] then gained the rights to his old albums and began to reissue them, first on his own and then through [b][l=Rykodisc][/b]. Throughout his recording career Zappa stayed consistently at the forefront of technology, investing in equipment, home-studio facilities and vault storage that would enable the fullest control over production of his works.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 his official autobiography emerged and he embarked on a world tour.

698	\N	Born: 1st February 1938, El Paso, Texas, USA.\r\nDied: 1st November 2008, Traunstein, Germany. \r\n\r\nAmerican drummer and vocalist. Best known for his work with [a=Frank Zappa] and original drummer in the first line-up of '[url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/286086-Mothers-The]The Mothers[/url]', with his introductory line "Hi, boys and girls - I’m Jimmy Carl Black, and I’m the Indian of the group”. Also referred to by [a=Don Van Vliet] as "Indian Ink" during their musical association. Black co-founded several groups and featured on many recordings after departing Zappa's band - with whom he made the first 8 albums. However, JCB appeared on some Zappa works thereafter, such as the vocalist on "Harder Than Your Husband" - a number on which he can also be seen performing with FZ (in Albuquerque) on friend John Cline's vid-clip on YouTube (To which FZ agreed).\r\n\r\nJCB met his wife Moni ([a3133949]) at a gig (whilst drumming with the Farrell/Black Blues Band) in Traunstein, Germany when he was 58. He spoke no German and she spoke no English, although the fact she had been a devoted Mothers fan for 25 years obviously helped communications and they married 11 months later. Soulmates until he passed away, Moni regularly accompanied him to Zappanale events. Black had almost completed a book of his life story when he died and it was finally published in the Fall of 2013, entitled "For Mother's Sake - The Memoirs And Recollections Of Jimmy Carl Black 1938-2008".\r\n\r\nBlack was first a member of The Soul Giants with [a=Roy Estrada] and [a=Ray Collins], who were joined by Zappa, whose concepts subsequently morphed the band into a Mothers line-up. After his long association with FZ, Black formed [a=Geronimo Black] with [a=Bunk Gardner] in 1970 (Geronimo Black also being the name of his 3rd son). He then co-founded [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/1663374-Grandmothers-The]The Grandmothers[/url] with Gardner, [a=Don Preston] and Collins in 1980. He also formed his own label '[l95759]', performed with [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/1155497-Muffin-Men-The]The Muffin Men[/url] and  and has collaborated with a diverse number of artists, including: [a=Arthur Brown], [a=Mannish Boys], [a=Ant-Bee], [a=Eugene Chadbourne] (Jack & Jim Show), [a=Sandro Olivia] (Black Olive), [a=Zjakki Willems], [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/3705791-X-tra-Combo-The]The X-tra Combo[/url], [a=Ener Bladezipper], [a=Ella Guru] and the artist who also worked on "The Jimmy Carl Black Story", [a=Jon Larsen].	2017-11-23 19:40:46.522817	2017-11-26 00:58:29.072077	18	Jimmy Carl Black

Monmouth, New Jersey. While in the service he looked forward to his visits to New York City where he studied with the finest teachers including Simeon Bellison on clarinet, Joe Allard on saxophone and Victor Goldring on flute.\r\nAfter serving in the Army, Johnny joined Raymond Scott’s band in New York and later, the bands of Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey. On a trip to California with Benny Goodman, he decided to make Hollywood his new home, and began working as a studio woodwind player.\r\nJohnny played in the reed section with Jerry Gray (arranger for Artie Shaw and chief arranger for The Glenn Miller Orchestra) on “Club 15”, a daily radio show on CBS featuring Bob Crosby, the Andrews Sisters, the Modernaires and Jo Stafford, and on all of Jerry Gray’s albums. Over the years he recorded with a wide range of artists, from Neil Diamond to Frank Zappa, was featured on the twin altos with the Billy Vaughn Orchestra and played on many sessions with Jimmie Haskell, Earle Hagen and Buddy Baker. He was a band regular on the “Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour” and played on many other television shows, including Andy Williams and Frank Sinatra. In addition to studio work, Johnny enjoyed playing in the orchestra for Broadway shows and other theatre productions in Los Angeles.\r\nA songwriter since his high school days, Johnny became a member of ASCAP in 1954. Always looking to improve his knowledge of music, he studied The Schillinger System of Musical Composition with Franklyn Marks, a longtime Walt Disney composer. He collaborated with such well-known lyricists as Johnny Mercer, Sammy Cahn, Ray Gilbert, Sidney Clare, Abbey Lincoln, Franz Steininger and Jerry Gladstone. Many of those collaborations are featured on his “Nothing But The Best” compilation CDs.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:40:46.541145	2017-11-26 00:58:57.086381	18	John Rotella

732	\N	British guitarist - songwriter (Not to be confused with the pop songwriter [b][a=John McLaughlin (2)][/b])\r\n* 4. January 1942 in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, England\r\nA household name since the early '70s, John McLaughlin was a fusion guitarist when he led the Mahavishnu Orchestra. He started on guitar when he was 11 and was initially inspired by blues and swing players. John McLaughlin worked with David Bowie, Alexis Korner, Graham Bond, Ginger Baker, and others in the 1960s and played free jazz with Gunter Hampel for six months. His first album was a classic (1969's Extrapolation) and was followed by an obscurity for the Dawns label with John Surman, a quintet set with Larry Young (Devotion), and My Goals Beyond in 1970 which was half acoustic solos and half jams involving Indian musicians.\r\nIn 1969, John McLaughlin moved to New York to play with Tony Williams' Lifetime and he appeared on two classic Miles Davis records: In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew. In 1971, John McLaughlin formed the [a=Mahavishnu Orchestra], a very powerful group often thought of as rock but having the sophisticated improvisations of jazz. After three influential albums (The Inner Mounting Flame, Birds of Fire, and Between Nothingness and Eternity), the group disbanded in 1973. John McLaughlin, who recorded a powerful spiritual album with Carlos Santana that was influenced by John Coltrane, put together a new Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1974 that, despite the inclusion of [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], failed to catch on and broke up by 1975. John McLaughlin then surprised the music world by radically shifting directions, switching to acoustic guitar and playing Indian music with his group Shakti. They made a strong impact on the world music scene (which was in its infancy) during their three years. John McLaughlin then went back and forth between electric and acoustic guitars; leading the One Truth Band; playing in trios with Al DiMeola and Paco De Lucia; popping up on some mid-'80s Miles Davis records; forming a short-lived third version of the Mahavishnu Orchestra (with saxophonist Bill Evans); recording an introspective tribute to pianist Bill Evans; and, in 1993, touring with a rollicking jazz trio featuring Joey DeFrancesco and drummer Dennis Chambers. Throughout his productive career John McLaughlin has recorded as a leader for Marmalade, Dawns, Douglas International, \t[l=CBS], [l=Warner Brothers], and Verve.	2017-11-23 19:40:58.399857	2017-11-26 01:02:28.081604	18	John McLaughlin

761	\N	A native of Britain, Steve Jolliffe has been an active keyboardist, flutist and saxophonist for over 35 years. His career started in 1967, when he met Rick Davies and formed a group called The Joint, which, after Steve left, evolved into Supertramp. Jolliffe's interest in classical music led him to the "Berlin High School for Music" in 1969. He was the first student accepted there who didn't have the ability to read music. And while at the school, he met Edgar Froese, and together with Klaus Schulze toured Germany as one of the earliest incarnations of Tangerine Dream. \r\n\r\nThat stint lasted nearly a year, and then Steve left Tangerine Dream and returned to England. There he joined a blues/rock band called Steamhammer, and toured Europe with them for the next several years. In 1973 Jolliffe left that group and scored several films, including the award-winning documentary Tattoo. \r\n\r\nSteve rejoined Tangerine Dream in 1978 and with Froese, Chris Franke and Klaus Krüger, recorded the album Cyclone. To this day, Cyclone remains a controversial album amongst TD aficionados, mostly due to Steve's vocals and lyrics. The quartet toured Europe that year and played to crowds of up to 100,000. Shortly afterward, Jolliffe left TD for the second time and went back to England to pursue a solo career. \r\n\r\nHe recorded several albums in the 1980s. Two of them, Journeys out of the Body and Beyond the Dream, are available through Horizon Music. Journeys, a 1982 release, featured a collaboration with the late guitarist Tony Duhig, formerly of Jade Warrior. Two years later, Steve issued Beyond the Dream, which once again featured lyrics and vocals. He also collaborated with Klaus Schulze on a Wahnfried album called Miditation. Jolliffe spent the rest of the decade recording library discs, which are meant to be used in films at will and not intended to be sold to the general public. \r\n\r\nIn 1990 Steve moved to America and released the album Escape the following year. During this time Jolliffe partnered with Horizon Music to distribute many of his CD's and, after releasing Warrior in 1992, became Horizon's first signee. He moved back to England in 1994 and released Alien, which was less electronic than previous efforts and featured extensive use of flute and saxophone. Then Steve explored a new musical direction with the ambient/trance CD Zanzi. He took this title from a French game of chance, and the disc was chosen by the nationally syndicated radio program Musical Starstreams as one of its Top Ten albums of 1996. Jolliffe also found the time to work with Eat Static members Merv Pepler and Joie Hinton (formerly of Ozric Tentacles) on their album Science of the Gods. After that, he released Omni, a logical follow-up to Zanzi. \r\n\r\n1999 saw Steve release a CD called Deep Down Far. Like much of his varied work, this disc draws on elements of traditional electronic, ambient and classical music structures. The opening track has been used in advertisements on the Discovery Channel in England. A year later, Jolliffe put out a compilation CD called Invitation, which features music from each of the aforementioned albums. \r\n\r\nSteve Jolliffe still lives in England and continues to collaborate occasionally with Pepler and Hinton.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:41:08.461945	2017-11-26 01:05:52.075405	18	Steve Jolliffe

He has since recovered feeling in his arm, and the band has reformed and begun to record and tour again.\r\n\r\nDave married Pam Casselberry in 1991, and they had two children together (a son, [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Justis+Mustaine]Justis David Mustaine[/url], born in 1992, and a daughter, Electra Nicole, born in 1998).

182	\N	Born: November 12, 1964 in Jackson, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nDavid Ellefson is best known as the original bass player for Megadeth, a band he helped found with guitarist/frontman [a=Dave Mustaine] in 1983 following Mustaine's dismissal from [a=Metallica].  Ellefson, known as "Junior" within the band, remained the only player to perform with Mustaine and Megadeth throughout the band's initial run from 1983 through 2002.  When Mustaine resurrected the Megadeth name in 2004, Ellefson was not included.  An unsuccessful lawsuit brought by Ellefson against Mustaine over Megadeth rights and royalties only served to heighten tensions between the former band mates.  Although Mustaine would announce that the two had eventually settled their personal differences, he did not foresee Ellefson ever rejoining the band, and Megadeth released 3 studio albums with different bassists.  In the meantime, Ellefson performed with the groups F5 and Hail and went to work for Peavy Amplifiers.  It then came as something of a shock when, in early 2010, it was announced that Ellefson had rejoined Megadeth.\r\n	2017-11-23 18:56:04.385308	2017-11-25 23:58:02.079958	8	David Ellefson

When longtime [a=Judas Priest] vocalist [a=Rob Halford] left the band in 1992, a lengthy application/auditioning process began to find a suitable replacement. Live video footage of Owens' Priest tribute band "British Steel" was sent to drummer [a=Scott Travis] and made enough of an impression for the band to fly him in to audition. After less than 2 songs he got the job, and officially joined the band in February of 1996.\r\n\r\nHe recorded 2 studio albums, 2 live albums and a live DVD with Priest before amicably departing for Halford's return in 2003.

Unfortunately, soon after achieving success with [a=Pink Floyd], he began to suffer from mental problems, possibly complicated by drug use, from which he never fully recovered. \r\n\r\nHaving become increasingly unpredictable in person and unreliable as performer, he was pushed out of the band in 1968. He continued with a brief solo career, releasing eclectic albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, before leaving the music industry and spending the rest of his life living in relative seclusion. \r\n\r\nBarrett had an infamous "reunion" with Pink Floyd in 1975, when he showed up at the mixing session for Shine On You Crazy Diamond, ironically a song written in tribute to him.

228	\N	Best known as lead singer of popular British rock group [a=Queen]. Born 5 September 1946 in Stone Town, Zanzibar, died 24 November 1991 in Kensington, London, UK. \r\n\r\nBorn as Farrokh Pluto Bulsara to Parsi parents Bomi and Jer Bulsara, he attended St. Peter's boarding school near Bombay and formed his first school band ("The Hectics") where he played piano.\r\nAt age 17 the Bulsara family fled to England during the Zanzibar revolution and Freddie (as he began calling himself) took up studies in art design. He also formed a band called "Ibex" (later renamed to "Wreckage") but they failed to take off. Soon after he joined another band called "Sour Milk Sea" but it also disbanded. \r\n\r\nIn 1970 he met [a=Brian May] and [a=Roger Taylor] who at the time were going under the name [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Smile+(6)]Smile[/url]. Quickly taking full charge, he changed the name to "[a=Queen]", and with his art design education designed the band's logo. It was also around this time that he changed his name to Frederick Mercury by deed poll.\r\n\r\nAs flamboyant a performer he was on stage, Mr. Mercury was equally adept at songwriting; it was his "Bohemian Rhapsody" that propelled the band to superstardom.\r\n\r\nBetween the late 1970's and early 1980's, Freddie took a break from the band to pursue a solo career, spending much time in Munich and New York. In 1987 he was diagnosed with HIV. Despite his illness he still recorded with Queen to finish one last album ("[r=889990]") and his last recorded song, "Mother Love" (which was to appear on the posthumous "[r=1383329]" album). As the disease took hold, public appearances and subsequent videos revealed a very thin Freddie -- yet he insisted on keeping his illness a secret. \r\n\r\nOn 24 November 1991, he died in his Kensington home, one day after announcing his illness, aged 45.\r\n	2017-11-23 18:57:28.372113	2017-11-26 00:03:30.102744	1	Freddie Mercury

233	\N	Ronald Belford "Bon" Scott (9 July 1946 – 19 February 1980) was an Australian rock musician, best known for being the lead singer and lyricist of Australian hard rock band AC/DC from 1974 until his death in 1980. He was born in Kirriemuir, Scotland, and emigrated to Melbourne, Australia with his family in 1952 at the age of six.\r\n\r\nScott formed his first band, The Spektors, in 1964 and became the band's drummer and occasional lead vocalist. He performed in several other bands including The Valentines and Fraternity before replacing Dave Evans as the lead singer of AC/DC in 1974.\r\n\r\nAC/DC's popularity grew throughout the 1970s, initially in Australia, and then internationally. Their 1979 album Highway to Hell reached the top twenty in the United States, and the band seemed on the verge of a commercial breakthrough. However, on 19 February 1980, Scott died after a night of partying in London. AC/DC briefly considered disbanding, but the group quickly recruited vocalist Brian Johnson of the British glam rock band Geordie. AC/DC's subsequent album, Back in Black, was released only five months later, and was a tribute to Scott. It went on to become the second best-selling album in history.\r\n\r\nBon was justifiably named the greatest rock frontman of all time in Classic Rock No.68.\r\n\r\nAuthor Clinton wrote a biography of Bon Scott with the title  'Highway To Hell: The Life & Times Of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott'.\r\n	2017-11-23 18:57:39.359075	2017-11-26 00:04:05.097759	1	Bon Scott

Born 30-10-1946 in Pontypridd, Wales, his first claim to fame was playing with The Squires, the [a=Tom Jones] backing group (1963-1969). By 1972, he had moved on to Manfred Mann's Earth Band and played with them until 1978, when he shortly joined with former Earth Band members to form the Band Terra Nova. But this band did not have a lot of success and dissolved quickly. His next real group was with Jimmy Page and Paul Rodgers in the Firm. That band wanted him so badly that they waited several months for him to finish a previous commitment with David Gilmour. After the demise of the Firm, Slade hooked up with AC/DC for quite a while. He then became the drummer for the prog rock group Asia for two albums. Most recently he is the drummer for british power rock group Damage Control.	2017-11-23 18:57:39.364989	2017-11-26 00:04:19.083757	1	Chris Slade

He quit Bad Religion in 1983 following the release of the "Into The Unknown" LP and spent several years mired in a drug addiction.  During that time, he worked for Chameleon Records.  In 1985, using the psuedonym "Billy Pilgrim", he recorded and released a 5 song E.P. under the moniker "The Seeing Eye Gods", collaborating with a friend who was allegedly his cocaine dealer.  In 1987, after getting sober, Brett rejoined Bad Religion and remained with the band until 1994, when he left again.  Officially, he left to concentrate on Epitaph after the success of the [a=Offspring], but it was later revealed that the real reason had to do with personal tension within the group and a blow-out fight with Jay Bentley was the final straw.  In 1996, Brett launched the Daredevils, who released a 7" called "Hate You", whose title track was said to be aimed at Bentley.  That group was sidetracked when Brett relapsed into drug abuse.  Brett eventually landed in jail on a drug possession charge before getting sober again.  In 2001, he rejoined Bad Religion.  However, his participation is limited to writing and studio work, as his focus is still on running Epitaph.

Daniels, who wrote "Carolina (I Love You)" about his youth, was the son of a lumberjack and was raised with a love of bluegrass music.

He then acquired skills on mandolin and fiddle, but had to modify his playing when he lost the tip of his ring finger in an accident in 1955. He formed a bluegrass band, ''The Misty Mountain Boys'', but the group changed its name to ''The Jaguars'' following the single ''Jaguar'', which they recorded in 1959 (produced by [a=Bob Johnston]). Daniels said, "for nine years we played every honky-tonk dive and low-life joint between Raleigh and Texas". This enabled him to master a variety of musical styles, but his only national success came in 1964 when he wrote an [a=Elvis Presley] B-side "It Hurts Me", a tender ballad that remains one of his best compositions.\r\n\r\nIn 1967, Daniels followed Bob Johnston his suggestion to accept regular session work in Nashville.

419	\N	Ali Shaheed Muhammad was born and raised in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. At an early age Ali became fascinated with music. His earliest memory of this fascination was toting around a yellow Mickey Mouse transistor radio he received as a gift. "I brought that with me everywhere; I was comforted by the sounds that came from that little box," he says. Other memories lead to house parties his mother would throw where his Uncle Mike would deejay. It was at one of these parties that the then eight-year-old Ali took control of the mixer and turntables and began his life long musical journey. Ali went from local neighborhood deejay to a world-renowned producer and musician, forming not one but two popular bands.\r\n\r\nThe first group, A Tribe Called Quest, was where "Mr. Muhammad" partnered up with band mates Q-Tip and Phife. The hip-hop trio recorded five albums. The three stand incontestable as hip-hop classics. Their innovation changed the sound of hip-hop and R & B with jazzy, melodic beats. Tribe exited the world via the same stage as The Beatles and The Police, but their influence still lives with artists like D’Angelo, Common, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, The Roots and Musiq.\r\n\r\nAfter Tribe, Ali co-founded a new super trio named Lucy Pearl. Here with band members Dawn Robinson and Raphael Saadiq, he was able to explore more of his music abilities. Lucy Pearl fused funk, rock, R & B and hip-hop bringing a new energy and sound which remains to be duplicated.\r\n\r\nAli is also a 4-time Grammy nominee -- twice with A Tribe Called Quest, once for works with D’Angelo and once for Lucy Pearl. With plenty of production credits, no Grammy wins and two defunct groups, what is left for the DJ with plenty more music in his soul?\r\n	2017-11-23 19:03:52.348167	2017-11-26 00:25:52.096586	2	Ali Shaheed Muhammad

525	\N	Born Georg Ruthenberg in Los Angeles, CA, on August 5, 1959, Smear ran away from home at the age of 13 to join a Jesus commune. Smear then attended an academic program for youths who were ostracized by public education. One of his classmates was vocalist Darby Crash, with whom he formed  [a=Germs] in the late '70s. Also including Lorna Doom (bass) and Don Bolles (drums), the Germs became one of the most influential punk groups to emerge from L.A.'s underground scene. However, Crash died from a heroin overdose in 1980, abruptly ending the Germs' incendiary existence. Smear released his first solo album, Ruthensmear, on [l=SST Records] in 1987; he recorded the follow-up, So You Fell in Love With a Musician, in 1992. A year later, Smear was asked by the [a=Red Hot Chili Peppers] to replace guitarist [a=John Frusciante]; however, he turned them down. Instead, Smear toured as a member of [a=Nirvana], establishing a close friendship with frontman [a=Kurt Cobain] and his wife [a=Courtney Love]. Smear briefly joined former Nirvana drummer [a=Dave Grohl]'s band [a=Foo Fighters], playing on the group's 1997 album The Colour and the Shape.

[a=Sonic Youth] paid homage to him in the chorus of "Screaming Skull"; in addition, Grohl idolized him as a teen. Balancing his musical contributions with acting, Smear can be seen in the videos for [a=Prince]'s "Raspberry Beret" and [a=No Doubt]'s "Don't Speak." Moreover, he was often featured on MTV's House of Style.	2017-11-23 19:25:15.553523	2017-11-26 00:38:13.081336	25	Pat Smear

After receiving a mixtape from Howlett, Flint came back with great enthusiasm, insisting that Howlett should be playing his tracks up on stage, and that Flint, along with friend Leeroy Thornhill, would dance to them.\r\nOriginally Flint was the band's dancer, but in 1996 he featured as the vocalist on the hit single "Firestarter". The accompanying video showcased Flint's new punk look. This trend continued with the next Prodigy single "Breathe", on which Flint performed the backing vocals, whilst Maxim performed lead.

He was born in Barking but raised in Rayne near Braintree in Essex, and grew up as a football and James Brown fan. Thornhill joined The Prodigy along with Keith Flint after they met Liam Howlett at a local rave club. Both were dancers for the band's live show.\r\n\r\nIn 2000 Thornhill left the band and went on to make various EPs under the guises of Longman and Flightcrank, however these projects never saw any substantial success. He now DJs at large venues and is still in touch with The Prodigy. During The Prodigy's 'Their Law' tour Thornhill was the DJ support act at several venues. He also works as a regular DJ.

653	\N	Composer, producer, leader of the band The Prodigy.\r\n\r\nBorn August 21, 1971 in Braintree, Essex. He was first influenced by hip hop music and culture when he began to attend school at Alec Hunter Humanities College in Braintree. He learned breakdancing alongside his crew called The Pure City Breakers, and DJed in his first band Cut 2 Kill. After a fight at a gig of the band, Liam left Cut 2 Kill and started to write his own music.\r\nHe became connected to rave music and he reportedly went to his first rave in 1989.\r\n\r\nOn weekends, he went to all the raves and when the clubs closed down in the early morning those ravers went on to party on the beach while Liam played a compilation of the latest rave tracks out of a van. One day, Keith Flint approached him and asked whether Liam could do some mixes for him. When Liam had done the mixes he would pass it to Keith. One night, when Keith and Leeroy Thornhill were returning from a rave, they flipped Liam’s tape onto side B (which was titled "the prodigy" in reference to the Moog synthesizer used) to find some of Liam's own tracks on it and got completely hooked. They decided to approach Liam and ask him if he wanted to play on stage with Keith and Leeroy dancing at the front of the stage. Liam agreed, and The Prodigy was born.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Liam was offered the chance to do a mix for Mary Anne Hobbs' radio show. He dug out some of his old favourite tracks again and this prompted him to release an edited (due to some copyright issues) version of the mix in February, 1999. It was the first material which was recorded in his new home studio "The Dirtchamber", so accordingly the album was to be called Prodigy presents Dirtchamber Sessions Volume 1.\r\n\r\nIn the end of January 2006, a compilation album titled Back to Mine: Liam Prodigy was released. It was a collection of Howlett's favourite tunes, including an exclusive Prodigy track called "Wake the Fuck Up", which is often performed as an intro in The Prodigy's live concerts.\r\n\r\nHowlett was a co-producer on the track "Immunize" from Australian drum and bass act Pendulum's third album Immersion, which was released in 2010.\r\n\r\nHusband of [a389490].\r\n	2017-11-23 19:33:25.390081	2017-11-26 00:53:12.081909	5	Liam Howlett

686	\N	Sax Player, Flautist\r\n\r\nFred Jackson was born in 1929, a Flautist and saxophonist, he only released one album and played on a handful of sessions for Blue Note before disappearing from the jazz scene in the mid-'60s. He deserved a better fate. Although he wasn't a wildly original tenor saxophonist, he was a solid journeyman who found a successful common ground between hard bop and earthy soul-jazz on his jazz sessions. His R&B-inflected style worked well on uptempo ravers and slow blues alike, and he had a nice, robust tone. Despite his attributes, he quietly faded away from jazz in the mid-'60s, after his lone album Hootin' 'N Tootin' failed to sell.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the '50s, he gained his experience playing with such popular artists as Paul Williams, Lil’ Green, Paul Gayton, Chuck Willis and also Lionel Hampton. He later was invited to join the supporting band for R&B vocalist Lloyd Price and frequently toured with Price.\r\n\r\nJackson made his recording debut in 1961, playing on a B.B. King session. Shortly afterward, he cut his first jazz record, appearing in organist Baby Face Willette's band on the album Face to Face. Impressed by his performance on the record, Blue Note offered the saxophonist a chance to lead his own session and he accepted. Along with his bandmates -- guitarist Willie Jones, organist Earl Vandyke and drummer Wilbert Hogan -- into the studio on February 2, 1965 to record the album that became Hootin' 'N Tootin'. Two months later, he went back to Van Gelder Studios with his supporting trio and bassist Sam Jones to record his second album. That session was never released, either because Hootin' 'N Tootin' sold poorly or because, as Alfred Lion's notes claimed, that the record was too short for release. The sessions finally appeared in 1998, when they were added as bonus tracks to the CD reissue of Hootin' 'N Tootin'.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:40:46.474612	2017-11-26 00:57:05.063831	18	Fred Jackson

741	\N	Born in Berlin, Germany, Christopher Franke studied classical music and composition at the Berlin Conservatory. Besides developing a love for classical music, Franke also experimented in eclectic music with the electronic/new age band Tangerine Dream between 1970 and 1987. Tangerine Dream enjoyed a very successful run, releasing over 36 albums and several motion picture soundtrack recordings.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Tangerine Dream in 1987 to explore new creative concepts and directions, Franke founded the Berlin Symphonic Orchestra in an effort to combine his signature "musical expressions" with an equal balance of orchestral, ethnic and electronic music. During this period, Franke released his first solo album, Pacific Coast Highway, followed by The London Concert in 1992. In 1994 he released Enchanting Nature, the positive response to that album paved the way for his biggest-selling solo effort to date, The Celestine Prophecy - A Musical Voyage which is considered by many to be one of the most creative new age albums ever produced. This was followed by a unique collaboration, Transformation Of Mind, which paired several poetic readings by Deepak Chopra, along with nine delicate compositions by Franke.\r\n\r\nWhile being recognized as a major force in new age music, Franke has also garnered a tremendous amount of attention for several film and television scores including Babylon 5 and Tarzan And The Lost City.\n	2017-11-23 19:41:08.397382	2017-11-26 01:03:32.088935	18	Christopher Franke
742	\N	Conrad Schnitzler (1937 - 4th August 2011) was an institution in the German electronic music scene for thirty years. He studied with Joseph Beuys in the mid 1960’s, and in the late sixties joined the then fledgling German rock band Tangerine Dream. He added a bizarre, conceptual approach to Tangerine Dream that catapulted the band to legendary status, documented on the bands first album “Electronic Meditation”. Schnitzler left after that first album, forming with his friends Moebius and Roedelius the band Kluster. Kluster recorded and released three albums before Schnitzler again left, this time to pursue his own work under his own name. Kluster continued with just Roedelius and Moebius under the name Cluster. Since the demise of Kluster, Schnitzler released hundreds of albums, cassettes, and CDs, both on his own, and on various labels around the world.

779	\N	Born: 2nd February 1940, Chelsea, London, UK.\r\nDied: 16th August 2000.\r\n\r\nCaddy was a UK guitarist, session artist and prolific arranger/producer of covers of popular hit songs and melodies, primarily with [l=Avenue Recordings].\r\n\r\nHe began his career as a founder member of the "Tornados", serious challengers to the Shadows as most popular British instrumentalists of the 1960s and best remembered for the million-selling "Telstar" single of 1962. The band scored three more instrumental entries with  "Globetrotter", "Robot" and "Ice Cream Man" in 1963's domestic Top 10, before the advent of Merseybeat and its emphasis on vocals rendered their style passé. \r\n\r\nUnlike the other band members Caddy was classically trained, serving as head chorister and leader of the school orchestra at Emanuel School, Battersea, a treble in Westminster Abbey choir and studying violin the Royal Academy of Music. His break came when he joined the "Five Nutters" skiffle group, who were omnipresent at their own KKK Club in Willesden. After a transitional period as "Bats Heath and the Vampires", they went professional as "Johnny Kidd And The Pirates" in 1958. One of the few UK 'homegrown rock 'n' rollers' regarded with awe, the band's TV debut was on ITV's "Disc Break" in 1959 with "Please Don't Touch". Much of its charm emanated from Caddy's galvanising riffs although, because Caddy was riven with self-doubt about his abilities, another guitarist picked the staccato lead on the band's climactic "Shakin' All Over". Whilst the single knocked Cliff Richard from the top spot in August 1960, it netted Caddy only a standard session fee of 15 guineas. Within a year "Johnny Kidd & The Pirates" were becalmed outside the Top 50 and Caddy, along with fellow Pirates, abandoned ship to retain their stage costumes as the "Cabin Boys" behind Tommy Steele's brother, Colin Hicks, a huge attraction in Italy. \r\n\r\nCaddy flew home from Italy after Hicks proved a difficult employer, landing on his feet after responding to a 'Melody Maker' advert with pal Clem Cattini as a mainstay of the Tornados, along Heinz Burt, George Bellamy and Roger LaVern. The band was originally assembled to back Ken Charles, Pamela Blue, John Leyton, Mike Berry and other protégés at the console of boffin Joe Meek in his RPM Studio in London's Holloway Road. Following a miss with "Popeye Twist", written by Caddy and drummer Cattini, the ethereal "Telstar" was taped as a routine backing track - albeit with a poignant "second subject" plucked by Caddy - hours before a show with Billy Fury in Great Yarmouth. Meek had transformed it overnight into the quintessential 1960s instrumental. Although later dismissing Meek's RPM sound as "unadulterated lift music", Caddy remained a Tornado throughout their period of greatest celebrity as respected sidemen, hit parade contenders and patron saints of myriad combos created in the same image - notably the "Volcanos" with "Polaris". The band's decline began with the departure of their 'teen factor' bassist Heinz Burt, shortly before the comparative flop of "Dragonfly" in 1963.  Caddy then departed after the release of 1964's "Away From It All", an album containing four of his compositions.\r\n\r\nAlthough well-placed to become a star in his own right Caddy preferred a 'back seat'. As Clem Cattini suggested: "He never achieved his potential because he didn't believe in himself." Caddy took a job as house arranger and producer for Avenue Records, a budget label specialising in covers of current hits where he performed as the [a400202]. He next moved to a similar post in Canada and emerged back in England in 1975. Caddy was involved in a remake of "Telstar" by a reconstituted "Tornados", but chose not to return to the public stage - although he was persuaded to pitch in occasionally when attending 'RPM Appreciation Society' evenings. It was at one such event in Lewisham in 1991 that Caddy gave his last public performance, playing the timeless "Telstar". \r\n	2017-11-23 19:41:32.372223	2017-11-26 01:07:57.085172	18	Alan Caddy

In the 1980's Schulze continued his hectic release schedule as well as recording several soundtracks and rebuilding his studio (he "went digital" in 1986), and whereas IC was shut down in 1983, the label Inteam was established the following year. \r\n\r\nIn the 1990's Schulze recorded several electronic interpretations of works by classical composers (most notably Wagner) as well as collaborating with opera singers and other classical music performers on his own albums. He also started collaborating with German ambient/techno artist Pete Namlook in the series "The Dark Side Of The Moog" on the latter's Fax label, and steered the Wahnfried project into a more modern techno- and trance-inspired direction.	2017-11-23 19:41:08.432891	2017-11-26 01:04:57.076683	18	Klaus Schulze

Then he went to Düsseldorf to study painting at the Arts Academy. Besides experimenting with colours and painting abstract pictures, he experimented with sounds, at first on cello, clarinet, tenorsaxophone, electric guitar, hawaii guitar, later with electronic instruments. In 1967, with other art students he founded the experimental music group [a=Pissoff]. Critical about the social development in Germany and the conservative rollback round about, the band demolished the established rules of music. In their concerts they played free improvised music for three hours non-stop, everyone playing as loud as possible - without harmony, avoiding correct pitch, defined structures and norms - and people liked it. \r\nPure freedom. Chaos. Acoustic terror.

The song Darlin' was denominated as "a bunch of daft punk" by a reviewer in the UK music magazine Melody Maker. Guy-Manuel de Homem-Cristo and Thomas Bangalter took over the expression "[a=Daft Punk]" as their next band name. In 1993 their first single "The New Wave" was released on [l=Soma Quality Recordings].

824	\N	Born in 1975. Part of the duo [a=Daft Punk], producer and writer. Son of [a=Daniel Bangalter] AKA [a=Daniel Vangarde], who composed [r=187160] for [a=Ottawan].\r\nAfter the experience of [a=Darlin'] and before the [a=Daft Punk] phenomena, Thomas Bangalter released the two famous EP's 'Trax On Da Rocks', a composite of various samples set to funky House and Techno beats.\r\n\r\nHe released 'Music Sounds Better With You' on his own label [l=Roulé] as part of [a=Stardust] as well as his remix for "Rock Shock" by [a=Roy Davis Jr.].\r\n\r\nIn 1998, his track 'Gym Tonic' was the center of a 'scandal' as [a=Bob Sinclar] included it on his album "Paradise" without the consent of Bangalter. This resulted in a law suit intended by guru fitness and actress Jane Fonda whose voice was illegally sampled on the record.\r\n\r\nA very 'anonymous' person, Bangalter nontheless gave a few interviews in and out of the [a=Daft Punk] phenomena. Although a lot of people credit him for the invention of 'filtered house', he cited [a=Carl Craig] AKA [a=Paperclip People] ("Throw") and [a=Kenny "Dope" Gonzalez] as precursors of the style.\r\nIt must also be noted that outside [a=Daft Punk], Bangalter stopped his DJing career due to ear problems. \r\n\r\nBangalter is married to French actress [a=Elodie Bouchez] with whom he has two sons: Tara-Jay (born 2002) and Roxan (born 2008).\r\n	2017-11-23 19:44:56.368748	2017-11-26 01:13:11.085889	20	Thomas Bangalter

35	Pieces Of A Dream	Founded in 1975 by James K. Lloyd (keyboards), Cedric Napoleon (bass) and Curtis Harmon (drums), they performed all over Philadelphia as 'Classic Touch', 'A Touch of Class', and 'Galaxy'. The group changed their name to 'Pieces Of A Dream' in 1979, a nod to “Pieces of Dreams,” a Stanley Turrentine tune that the group performed. They were discovered by Grover Washington, Jr. whilst performing as the house band on TV show "City Lights". Grover went on to produce their first three albums Pieces of a Dream, We Are One and Imagine This. Soon after completing Joyride, their last effort for Elektra, they moved to EMI/Blue Note and went on to record seven more albums. During this period, the group amicably parted ways with long time friend Cedric Napoleon. Signed with Heads Up International in 2001 and have so far released four albums: Acquainted with the Night, Love's Silhouette, No Assembly Required and Pillow Talk.\r\nPersonnel currently consist of Lloyd, Harmon, Eddie Baccus Jr.(saxophone), Todd Parsnow (guitar) and Tracy Hamlin (vocals).\r\nWere (and still are) managed by the drummer’s father and uncle, Danny and Bill Harmon, respectively.\r\n	2017-11-23 18:55:00.344401	2017-11-23 18:55:00.344401	14
36	Metallica	Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Los Angeles, California (USA).\r\n\r\nMetallica formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich.  The duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper.  At the time, Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on an upcoming compilation record called “Metal Massacre”.   Metallica’s contribution, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist Lloyd Grant.  Afterwards, Ron McGovney became the band's bassist and Dave Mustaine joined the band as lead guitarist.  This line-up would re-record "Hit The Lights" for subsequent re-pressings of "Metal Massacre" and would also issue several demos.  In 1983, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by Cliff Burton, which also saw the band relocate to San Francisco.  Metallica then traveled to New York after signing a deal with [l=Megaforce Records].  However, once in New York, the band fired Mustaine.  It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press.  Mustaine was replaced by Kirk Hammett of [a=Exodus (6)].\r\n\r\nMetallica's debut LP, "Kill 'Em All", was released in 1983.  It was followed in 1984 by "Ride The Lightning".  This led to a major label deal with [l=Elektra].  In 1986, the band released "Master Of Puppets", which is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time.  In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton.  Eventually, Jason Newsted (of [a=Flotsam And Jetsam]) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 1987's "Garage Days Re-Revisited", an EP of cover tunes.  \r\n\r\nIn 1990, Metallica hooked up with producer [a=Bob Rock] for a self-titled release that would become better known as "The Black Album", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 million copies in the US alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, the band experimented with Rock music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album "Load".  The following year, "Reload" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music.  In 1999, the group released an album and accompanying film called "S&M", which featured Metallica performing their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, as the band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal and musical reasons.  Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse.  The album, called "St. Anger", was eventually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass.  Upon its release, "St. Anger" drew mostly negative reviews.  Following the recording, Robert Trujillo, formerly of [a=Suicidal Tendencies], was hired as bassist.  The making of the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, "Death Magnetic", produced by [a=Rick Rubin], would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's return to thrash metal.  The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.  Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf.  Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend.  In 2011, Metallica collaborated with [a=Lou Reed] on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics and ignored by consumers.    \r\n	2017-11-23 18:55:29.336713	2017-11-23 18:55:29.336713	8
37	Iron Maiden	Founded in Leyton in London's East End in 1975, Iron Maiden released their first album in 1980 as a five-piece with [a=Paul Di'Anno] on vocals. [a=Bruce Dickinson] would replace him in 1981. With several line-up changes [a=Steve Harris] would remain the only original member never to have had a hiatus. \r\n\r\nWhen [a=Bruce Dickinson] quit in 1994 and was replaced by [a=Wolfsbane]'s [a=Blaze Bayley], the band lost a lot of their fanbase. They recorded two albums with Blaze before [a=Bruce Dickinson] and [a=Adrian Smith (2)] returned to the fold for 2000's "Brave New World", and 2003's "Dance of Death", making them a six-piece. As of 1999 the line-up hasn't changed\r\n\r\nBand Members:\r\n\r\n[b]Vocals[/b]\r\n[a=Paul Mario Day] (1975-1976)\r\nDennis Wilcock (1976-1977)\r\n[a=Paul Di'Anno] (1978-1981)\r\n[a=Blaze Bayley] (1994-1998)\r\n[a=Bruce Dickinson] (1981-1993 and 1999-present)\r\n\r\n[b]Drums[/b]\r\nBarry "[a=Thunderstick]" Purkis (1977)\r\n[a=Doug Sampson] (1977-1979)\r\n[a=Clive Burr] (1980-1982)\r\n[a=Nicko McBrain] (1982-present)\r\n\r\n[b]Guitar[/b]\r\n[a=Dave Murray (2)] (1976-present)\r\n[a=Dennis Stratton] (1979-1980)\r\n[a=Adrian Smith (2)] (1980-1990 and 1999-present)\r\n[a=Janick Gers] (1990-present)\r\n\r\n[b]Bass[/b]\r\n[a=Steve Harris] (1975-present)\r\n\r\n[b]Keyboards[/b] \r\n[a=Michael Kenney] (1986-present) (Live performances only, not a full member)	2017-11-23 18:55:40.413903	2017-11-23 18:55:40.413903	8
38	Black Sabbath	Considered by many to be the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath was formed in 1968 by [a=Tony Iommi], [a=Ozzy Osbourne], [a=Geezer Butler] and [a=Bill Ward].  The band's original name was the Polka Tulk Blues Band (later shortened to Polka Tulk) and later Earth before becoming Black Sabbath.  The original line-up lasted until 1979, after which Osbourne was fired and replaced by [a=Ronnie James Dio]. The line-up changes would continue, with no line-up remaining intact for consecutive studio releases. Throughout the changes, only Tony Iommi and keyboardist [a=Geoff Nicholls], who also joined the band in 1979, would remain with Black Sabbath, although Nicholls would not always be credited as a full member. In 1997, Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne reunited, touring and releasing a live album in 1998, although a long-rumored studio release did not appear (the group attempted to record a new album in 2001 with producer [a=Rick Rubin] but the sessions were scrapped). After that, the group periodically reunited to tour with Ozzy's "Ozzfest" tour. In 2004, longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was replaced by [a=Adam Wakeman] for an Ozzfest tour. No reason was given for the replacement. In 2006, the original line-up was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio, and drummer [a=Vinny Appice] (who were featured on 1981's "Mob Rules" and 1992's "Dehumanizer") announced that they would tour together as [a=Heaven & Hell (2)] (with Iommi, who owns the Black Sabbath name, deciding to keep the Black Sabbath name solely for the original line-up in light of their Rock 'n' Roll HOF induction) to support a Dio-era greatest hits release, which also featured 3 new Dio/Iommi compositions. A brand new live album was released under the Heaven & Hell name that same year, followed by a studio album in 2009. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Osbourne sued Iommi over control of the Black Sabbath name.  The lawsuit was settled the following year.  In late 2011, it was announced that the original line-up would be recording and touring.  Shortly, afterward, Bill Ward dropped out, stating he had been given a contract that was "unsignable".  The three remaining members opted to continue without him.  In 2013, the band released "13", their first studio album with Osbourne in 34 years.  The band played their final live show in Birmingham, UK, on February 4, 2017.  Although the band has announced that full-scale touring is done, Tony Iommi has stated that the door is still open for future music and possible live appearances. \r\n\r\nLine-Ups:\r\nGuitar:\r\nTony Iommi - 1968-2017\r\n\r\nVocals:\r\nOzzy Osbourne - 1968-1977, 1978-1979, 1997-2017\r\nDave Walker - 1977-1978 (rehearsals and a TV appearance only)\r\nRonnie James Dio - 1979-1982, 1991-1992\r\nIan Gillan - 1983-1984\r\nGlenn Hughes - 1985-1986\r\nRay Gillen - 1986-1987 (live only)\r\nTony Martin - 1987-1991, 1993-1996\r\n\r\nBass:\r\nGeezer Butler - 1968-1984, 1991-1994, 1997-2017\r\nCraig Gruber - 1979 (rehearsals only while Butler contemplated leaving the band, the extent of his participation has been disputed)\r\nGordon Copley -1985 (rehearsals and one studio track only)\r\nDave "The Beast" Spitz - 1985-1986, 1987 (live appearances only in 1987)\r\nBob Daisley - 1987 (studio only)\r\nJo Bert - 1987 (live only)\r\nLaurence Cottle - 1988 (studio only)\r\nNeil Murray - 1989-1992, 1995-1996\r\n\r\nDrums:\r\nBill Ward - 1968-1980, 1983 (studio only in 1983), 1994 (live appearances), 1997-2011\r\nVinny Appice - 1981-1982, 1991-1992, 1998 (live only in 1998, filling in for a sick Bill Ward)\r\nBev Bevan - 1983-1984, 1987 (live only)\r\nEric Singer - 1985-1987\r\nTerry Chimes - 1987-1988 (live only)\r\nCozy Powell - 1988-1991, 1994-1995\r\nBobby Rondinelli - 1993-1994, 1995 (live appearances only in 1995)\r\nMike Bordin - 1997 (live only, not a full member)\r\nBrad Wilk - 2013 (studio only, not a full member)\r\nTommy Clufetos - 2012-2017 (live only, not a full member)\r\n\r\nKeyboards:\r\nRick Wakeman - 1973 (studio only, not a full member)\r\nJezz Woodruffe - ?-1977 (not a full member)\r\nDon Airey - 1978 (not a full member)\r\nGeoff Nicholls - 1979-2004\r\nAdam Wakeman - 2004-2017 (live only, not a full member)\r\n	2017-11-23 18:55:52.336447	2017-11-23 18:55:52.336447	8
39	Megadeth	Formed: 1983 in Los Angeles, California. Disbanded: 2002. Reformed: 2004.\r\n\r\nAmerican Thrash Metal band formed by guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine and bass guitarist David Ellefson following the formers ejection from [a=Metallica].\r\n\r\nDespite countless line-up changes, Megadeth is partly responsible for the popularization of Thrash Metal in the late 1980s. The band was also notorious for its substance abuse, a contributing factor to their continuous revolving door of band members. The group nonetheless found sobriety and a stable line up with 1990's [r=2017460], a trend which continued until 1998 with the departure of drummer Nick Menza. \r\n\r\nDave Mustaine disbanded Megadeth in 2002 due to a nerve injury he had suffered on his left arm. Following a year of physical therapy Mustaine began work on what was to be his first solo album, however contractual obligations forced [r=379626] to be released under the Megadeth name, following which, Mustaine decided to reform the band.\r\n	2017-11-23 18:56:04.348741	2017-11-23 18:56:04.348741	8
40	Judas Priest	Judas Priest is a pioneering British Heavy Metal band and was a forerunner in the ‘New Wave of British Heavy Metal’ movement, laying the groundwork for the speed and thrash metal of the ’80s and ’90s with numerous classic albums.\r\n\r\nThe band was formed in Birmingham, England in 1969 by guitarist John Perry (who died shortly after and was replaced by Earnest Chataway), bassist Bruno Stapenhill, drummer John Partridge, and singer [a=Alan Atkins], who created a band name from Bob Dylan's song '[i][r=3881740][/i]'. In 1970, guitarist Kenneth [a=K. K. Downing] and bassist [a=Ian Hill (2)] joined, replacing Chataway and Stapenhill. Later, in 1972, [a=Rob Halford] and drummer [a=John Hinch] joined to replace Atkins and Partridge, respectively. A second guitarist, [a=Glenn Tipton], was also added to the line-up in 1974 as compensation for its record company’s (Gull Records) suggestion to add a horn section to the first album, Rocka Rolla.\r\n\r\nThe band featuring Halford, Downing, Tipton and Hill would go on to record 14 albums from 1974 through to 1990. Priest went through a considerable amount of drummers between its formation and 1980 when [a=Trapeze] drummer [a=Dave Holland] joined and stayed until 1988’s Ram It Down. In early 1990 [a=Racer X] drummer [a=Scott Travis] joined the band and recording began on its Painkiller album. In mid 1990 the band was taken to court over the attempted suicide of two young boys in Reno, allegedly driven by subliminal messages on its Stained Class album. The case was eventually thrown out of court and in September 1990, Painkiller was released.\r\n\r\nHalford left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career but the band was determined to find a suitable replacement vocalist. Tim "Ripper" Owens, an Ohioan tribute band singer was chosen after a lengthy auditioning process and the band recorded 4 albums (2 studio, 2 live) with Owens.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Judas Priest’s 1990 line-up was restored when Rob Halford returned to the group after rekindling the relationship during work on Judas Priest’s 4-CD career retrospective “Metalogy.” In 2004 the band played Ozzfest and released a CD of new studio material entitled Angel of Retribution and an accompanying live DVD in 2005, enjoying a successful world tour that year. This was followed by the 2CD concept album Nostradamus in 2008 and the release of its fifth live album in 2009.\r\n	2017-11-23 18:56:16.340216	2017-11-23 18:56:16.340216	8
41	Led Zeppelin	Led Zeppelin formed out of the ashes of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/262455-Yardbirds-The]The Yardbirds[/url].  [a180585] had joined the band in its final days, playing a pivotal role on the group's final album, 1967's [m=86344], which also featured string arrangements from [a60149].  During 1967, the Yardbirds were fairly inactive.  Whilst the band members decided the group's future, Page returned to session work in 1967. In the spring of 1968, he played on Jones' arrangement of [a=Donovan]'s "Hurdy Gurdy Man." During the sessions, Jones requested to be part of any future project Page would develop. Page would have to assemble a band sooner than he had planned. In the summer of 1968, the Yardbirds' [a=Keith Relf] and [a=Jim McCarty] left, leaving Page and bassist [a=Chris Dreja] with the rights to the name, as well as the obligation of fulfilling an upcoming fall tour. Page set out to find a replacement vocalist and drummer. Initially, he wanted to enlist singer Terry Reid and Procol Harum's drummer B.J. Wilson, but neither musician was able to join the group. Reid suggested that Page contact Robert Plant, who was singing with a band called Hobbstweedle.\r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 (Performer). \r\n	2017-11-23 18:56:53.339817	2017-11-23 18:56:53.339817	1
42	The Beatles	British rock/pop group, formed in Liverpool, England during the late 1950s. Signed to recording contract with EMI in 1962.\r\n\r\nThe lineup (1962-70) comprised John Lennon (vocals, guitar, harmonica, keyboards), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass, guitar, keyboards, percussion), George Harrison (guitar, vocals, sitar), and Ringo Starr (drums, vocals, percussion). During 1961, Stu Sutcliffe (bass) and Pete Best (drums) were also members.\r\n\r\nFollowing an initial period as a straightforward Mersey-beat group, later recordings saw them experiment with psychedelia, incorporating innovative production techniques involving tape loops and other effects. Although the group split in 1970, they have continued to release special products. \r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 (Group).

48	ZZ Top	ZZ Top is an American rock band formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons, bassist and co-lead vocalist Dusty Hill, and drummer Frank Beard. The band and its members went through several reconfigurations throughout 1969, achieving their current form when Hill replaced bassist Billy Etheridge in February 1970, shortly before the band was signed to London Records. Etheridge's departure issued primarily from his unwillingness to be bound by a recording contract.\r\n\r\nSince the release of the band's debut album in January 1971, ZZ Top has become known for its strong blues roots and humorous lyrical motifs, relying heavily on double entendres and innuendo. ZZ Top's musical style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired rock on their early albums, then incorporating New Wave, punk rock and dance-rock, with heavy use of synthesizers.\r\n\r\nZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. As a group, ZZ Top possesses 11 gold records and 7 platinum (13 multi-platinum) records; their 1983 album, Eliminator, remains the group's most commercially successful record, selling over 10 million units. ZZ Top also ranks 80th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units.\r\n\r\n	2017-11-23 18:58:33.333601	2017-11-23 18:58:33.333601	16

53	The Clash	Influential British punk group from west and south London, active between 1976 and 1985. Adding catchy sloganistic socio-political lyrics to their brand of garage rock 'n' roll, the band soon explored wider musical horizons than most of their contemporaries, incorporating reggae, dub, rockabilly, hip hop and funk influences into their music and a whole lot more. \r\nThe US saw the 2nd album "Give 'Em Enough Rope" relased before the first to coincide with the band's first transatlantic tour in early 1979 (and like in Japan and in Canada) the 1st LP "The Clash" was soon repackaged with an updated track list and the addition of a free 7" "Groovy Times" / "Gates Of The West" which wasn't released separately. A year later they were receiving worlwide acclaim with their classic double album "London Calling".\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 (Performer), their classic line-up comprised [a=Joe Strummer] (vocals / guitar, b. John Graham Mellor August 21, 1952 Ankara, Turkey d. Dec 22, 2002 Broomfield, Somerset, England), Paul Simonon (bass, b.December 15, 1955), Mick Jones (guitar, b.

54	Misfits	The Misfits are an American horror-themed punk rock band from Lodi, New Jersey. Formed in early 1977, they took the band name from Marilyn Monroe's last film and in fact, thanked the cast of the movie on the back of their first record. The founding members were: Glenn Danzig on vocals and electric piano, Jerry Caiafa (Jerry Only) on bass, and Manny on drums. Their first release on their own label, Blank Records, didn't reflect the characteristic anger and rebellion of most "punk" records, but instead a more brooding and sinister, yet romantic side lingering beneath.  Following the single, Danzig and Only recruited a new drummer and added a guitar player and pursued the horror-based punk rock direction that they are known for.  Danzig and Only presided over several line up changes, eventually culminating with Jerry's younger brother, Paul (aka Doyle) becoming the band's permanent guitarist.\r\n\r\nThe original Misfits broke up in October 1983, having released several 7" singles and 12" records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors' items.  The bulk of the band's material was released on Glenn's Plan 9 label.  The band's popularity grew exponentially following their split and their material and tapes of their live shows were heavily bootlegged.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Misfits' dissolution, Danzig formed a new band called Samhain while Jerry Only and Doyle, heavily in debt to their father over band expenses, stepped away from music to work full time jobs at their father's company.  Between 1986 and 1988, Glenn continued to issue unreleased and out of print Misfits material.  Some of the songs on these collections featured guitar and bass tracks re-recorded by Glenn while others were all new recordings of old songs performed by Glenn and his Samhain bandmate Eerie Von.  These collections were released by Plan 9 records.  Jerry Only eventually contacted Danzig about royalties from these releases which resulted in a lawsuit between the two.  In 1995, an out of court settlement was reached that gave Only the rights to the Misfits name while Glenn maintained control of the publishing for the band's old material and the Plan 9 label was terminated. \r\n\r\nJerry Only and Doyle reformed The Misfits in 1995, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, "American Psycho" and "Famous Monsters" as well as a collection of rare and unreleased "resurrected" Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando.  Doyle went on "indefinite hiatus" from the band, later stating he was frustrated with decisions that his brother had made regarding the band.  In 2004, Doyle reconnected with Glenn Danzig and has periodically made live appearances with Glenn to perform Misfits tunes.  Meanwhile, Jerry Only took over the vocalist spot in the Misfits while recruiting former Black Flag vocalist Dez Cadena to play guitar and Marky Ramone for the drums.  Ramone eventually left and was replaced by former Misfits and Black Flag drummer Robo, who was later replaced by Eric "Chupacabra" Arce.  In 2001, Only and associate John Cafiero set up Misfits Records to release new material by the band.  After releasing an album of cover tunes in 2003, the Only-fronted line up released it's first album of original tunes in 2011.	2017-11-23 19:00:01.338731	2017-11-23 19:00:01.338731	22
55	Bad Religion	Punk/Rock band formed in 1980 in San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles, CA, US by [a=Greg Graffin] (vocals), [a=Brett Gurewitz] (guitar), [a=Jay Ziskrout] (drums), and [a=Jay Bentley] (bass). All the members were teenagers when the band started. Only Graffin has remained with the band through every phase of its career, although Bentley and Gurewitz have participated for substantial chunks of time. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band's primary songwriters, with other members contributing occasionally. The band is known for their rapid-fire songs with a melodic edge and strong backing harmonies.\r\n\r\nBad Religion released their first record, a self-titled EP, in 1981 on [l=Epitaph] Records, a label Gurewitz started after borrowing money from his father.  The band released their first full length, "How Could Hell Be Any Worse?", in 1982. Midway through the recording for the album, Ziskrout quit the band and the record was finished with drummer Pete Finestone. In 1983, the band abruptly shifted gears, issuing the keyboard-heavy, prog rock influenced "Into The Unknown", on which neither Bentley (who quit during the recording of the first track) nor Finestone appeared. The results were disastrous, with the band facing considerable backlash from fans and Epitaph immediately pulling the album off record store shelves. For his part, Gurewitz blamed his participation on his increasing drug habit, although he was quick to point out that the sober Graffin had no such excuse to fall back on, and has disowned the album. With Epitaph out of money and the band's reputation in tatters, Gurewitz quit and the band split. Graffin soon moved out of state for college, but returned to California in 1984 and was convinced by [a=Circle Jerks] guitarist Greg Hetson to reform Bad Religion with him on guitar. Recruiting Pete Finestone and bassist Tim Gallegos, the band issued a 12" EP, called "Back To The Known", with Gurewitz producing but not playing on the record.\r\n\r\nGraffin and Hetson spent the next few years playing sporadically with various line-ups. Eventually, Finestone and Bentley returned on a full-time basis. In 1987, a newly sober Brett Gurewitz returned to the fold and the band continued as a five-piece. In 1988, Bad Religion issued a new LP, "Suffer", to enthusiastic fans and critics. This lineup released 2 more albums before Finestone departed in 1991. He was replaced by Bobby Schayer. In 1993, immediately following the release of their 7th LP, "Recipe For Hate", the band jumped from Epitaph to [l=Atlantic] Records. Following the release of 1994's "Stranger Than Fiction", Brett Gurewitz left the group. Officially, it was said that his reason for leaving was to concentrate on Epitaph following the huge commercial success of the album "Smash" by [a=The Offspring], and he also expressed displeasure with the band's deal with Atlantic. However, it was later revealed the Gurewitz's primary reason for leaving was due to tension with Bentley (in 1996, Gurewitz released a single with his new band, [a=Daredevils], whose A-side, "Hate You" was written about Bentley). Graffin and Gurewitz also publicly feuded for a short time after the departure. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker (ex-[a=Minor Threat] and [a=Dag Nasty]). The band would record 3 more albums for Atlantic with Graffin as the primary songwriter, although 1998's "No Substance" featured significant contributions from the other members of Bad Religion. However, the albums were met with largely mixed critical and commercial responses. Meanwhile, Gurewitz had relapsed into drug abuse and faced a number of personal and legal problems. In 2000, a cleaned-up and sober Gurewitz made a guest appearance on the band's LP, "The New America", prompting rumors of a reunion. The album was the group's last for Atlantic.\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of "The New America", Bobby Schayer exited the group, as a shoulder injury barred him from playing drums. His replacement was Brooks Wackerman (ex-[a=Suicidal Tendencies]). In 2001, it was announced that not only had Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band, but that they would also be returning to Epitaph Records. It turned out the Brett's role would be mostly limited to songwriting and production, as his work with Epitaph makes extended touring impractical, although he would make appearances with the band when they performed in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that since the reunion, Gurewitz rarely actually plays guitar on the albums. Most of the guitar parts are recorded by Brian Baker as he is the most proficient guitarist, although Gurewitz does record parts if he wants to. The band has continued to record and tour steadily since returning to Epitaph.	2017-11-23 19:00:13.345917	2017-11-23 19:00:13.345917	22
56	The Carter Family	American traditional folk music group, formed in 1927. Their music was hugely influential for bluegrass, country, folk, and rock musicians. The original group split up when A.P. Carter and Sara Carter left in 1944, but Maybelle Carter and her daughters continued performing as [a1353326]. In the 1960's, [a1353326] reclaimed the name The Carter Family.\r\n\r\nMembership (as [a307357], 1927-1944, ~1960 to 1996; as [a1353326], 1944-~1960):\r\nA.P.

59	The Louvin Brothers	Please only use this profile for credits with the word "Brothers", "Bros." etc. Individual credits for Charlie and Ira should be linked to their respective profiles.\r\n\r\nAn American country vocal/harmony duet, consisting of brothers Ira and Charlie Loudermilk. Their professional career began after winning a talent contest by singing "There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Sea." Brief stints on Apollo, Decca, and MGM led to them being signed by Capitol Records. At first their recordings were strictly gospel, but they switched to country with the 1955 release of "When I Stop Dreaming." Their career continued until 1963 when they broke up due to Ira's volatile temper. Charlie began a successful solo career in 1964. Ira was killed in a car wreck in Jefferson City, Missouri on June 20, 1965.  Songs he had recorded for a solo album were released posthumously.\r\n\r\nThe Louvin Brothers were inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:01:05.3438	2017-11-23 19:01:05.3438	11
60	The Charlie Daniels Band	The Charlie Daniels Band was formed in 1970, with [a=Charlie Daniels] joined by [a=Barry Barnes] (guitar), [a=Mark Fitzgerald] (bass), [a=Fred Edwards] and [a=Gary Allen] (drums), and [a=Taz DiGregorio] (keyboards). They started recording southern rock-styled albums for [l=Kama Sutra]. Although a multi-instrumentalist, Daniels was a limited vocalist, but his voice was well suited to the talking-style "Uneasy Rider", which reached the US Top 10 in 1973. He followed it with his anthem for southern rock, "The South's Gonna Do It". In 1974, Daniels had members of [a=The Marshall Tucker Band] and [a=The Allman Brothers Band] join him onstage in Nashville. It was so successful that he decided to make his so-called Volunteer Jam an annual event. It led to some unlikely combinations of artists such as [a=James Brown] performing with [a=Roy Acuff], and the stylistic mergers have included [a=Crystal Gayle] singing the blues with the Charlie Daniels Band.\r\n\r\nThe Charlie Daniels Band underwent some personnel changes on 1975's Nightrider, with [a=Tom Crain], [a=Charlie Hayward] and [a=Don Murray (3)] replacing Barnes, Fitzgerald and Allen respectively. When Daniels moved to [l=Epic] in 1976, there was a concerted effort to turn the band into a major concert attraction, despite the fact that at 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing 20 stone Daniels was no teenage idol: he hid his face under an oversized cowboy hat. The albums sold well, and in 1979, when recording his Million Mile Reflections album, he recalled a 20s poem, "The Mountain Whipporwill", by Stephen Vincent Benet. The band developed this into "The Devil Went Down To Georgia", in which Johnny outplays the Devil to win a gold fiddle. Daniels overdubbed his fiddle seven times to create an atmospheric recording that topped the US country charts and reached number 3 in the US pop charts. It was also a UK Top 20 success.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 the band recorded "In America" for the hostages in Iran, and then in 1982, "Still In Saigon" , about Vietnam. The band were featured on the soundtrack for Urban Cowboy and also recorded the theme for the Burt Reynolds movie Stroker Ace. The 13th Volunteer Jam was held in 1987, but financial and time constraints meant the event was put on temporary hiatus (it resumed four years later). In the late 80s Daniels appeared in the movie Lone Star Kid and published a book of short stories, but continued touring and playing his southern boogie to adoring audiences.\r\n\r\nDuring the 90s Daniels updated "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" with [a=Johnny Cash] and continued in his politically incorrect way - in simple language, he advocates both lynching and red-baiting; not a man to stand next to at the bar. He signed a new recording contract with [l=Liberty] in 1993, but also targeted the white gospel market through a deal with [l=Sparrow Records]. The albums The Door and Steel Witness earned Daniels several awards from the Christian recording community. In 1997 Daniels inaugurated his own [l=Blue Hat Records] and also released his first children's album, By The Light Of The Moon: Campfire Songs & Cowboy Tunes, on the Sony Wonder label. Two years later he took his Volunteer Jam event on the road for the first time.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:01:16.345927	2017-11-23 19:01:16.345927	11

62	N.W.A.	U.S. American group, seminal purveyors of the gangsta rap sub-genre. N.W.A. stands for "Niggaz Wit Attitudes." They were active from 1986 to 1991 and shortly in 1999/2000.\r\n\r\nN.W.A released [m=40320] in 1987 on Macola Records, which was later included on the compilation [m=139509]. The group was still in its developing stages, and only credited on four of the eleven tracks, notably the uncharacteristic electro-hop record "Panic Zone," "8-Ball," and "Dopeman," which marked the first collaboration of [a76220], DJ [a12330],  [a50513], and [a13732]. Hispanic rapper [a663863] co-wrote "Panic Zone," which was originally called "Hispanic Zone," but the title was later changed when Dr. Dre advised Krazy-Dee that the word "hispanic" would hinder sales. Also included was [a76073]'s solo track "Boyz-n-the Hood."\r\n\r\nIn 1988, rapper [a100748] joined N.W.A. and later that year, the group released their debut album [m=26117]. Though not a success at first, "Straight Outta Compton" helped pave the way for the emerging gangsta rap scene in the 1980s, and reached number 37 in the Billboard Top 200 in May 1989, while it reached number 9 on Billboard's Top Soul LPs. The album managed to sell over three million copies without any airplay, and spawned three singles, two of them charting successfully: "Straight Outta Compton," "Gangsta Gangsta" and "Express Yourself".\r\n\r\nIce Cube left in December 1989 over royalty disputes -- having written almost half of the lyrics on "Straight Outta Compton" himself, he felt he was not getting a fair share of the money and profits. He wasted little time putting together his solo debut, 1990's [m=97462], but he avoided mentioning his former label mates. Instead of breaking up, N.W.A. decided to continue without Ice Cube, releasing the EP [m=26111], which went platinum. Their 1991 follow-up album [m=26113] (also referred to as "Niggaz4Life") was the first hip-hop full-length album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. Shortly after the release of "Efil4zaggin," N.W.A. disbanded. All members continued making music since then, with Dr. Dre going solo and Eazy-E running Ruthless Records and releasing more music until he died of AIDS in 1995.	2017-11-23 19:03:29.336818	2017-11-23 19:03:29.336818	2

64	A Tribe Called Quest	This US male rap outfit originally comprised [a=Q-Tip] (b. Jonathan Davis ―later changed to Kamaal Ibn John Fareed, in the mid-1990's, on conversion to Islam― 10 April 1970, New York, USA), DJ [a=Ali Shaheed Muhammad] (b. 11 August 1970, Brooklyn, New York City, USA), [a=Jarobi] and [a=Phife Dawg] (b. Malik Taylor, 20 November 1970, Brooklyn, New York City, USA; d. 22 March 2016, USA). They formed at school in Manhattan, New York, where they started out as part of the Native Tongues Posse, with [a=Queen Latifah] and the [a=Jungle Brothers], and were given their name by [a=Afrika Baby Bambaataa] of the Jungle Brothers. \r\n\r\nFollowing their August 1989 debut, "Description Of A Fool", they had a hit with "Bonita Applebum" a year later, which was apparently based on a real person from their school. \r\nTheir biggest success came the following year with the laid-back "Can I Kick It?", typical of their refined jazz/hip-hop cross-match. A UK Top 20 single, it was later used extensively in television advertisements. Q-Tip also appeared on Deee-Lite's August 1990 hit, "Groove Is In The Heart". \r\n\r\nAs members of the Native Tongues Posse they were promoters of the Afrocentricity movement, which set out to make US Africans aware of their heritage, a theme emphasized in the group's music. \r\n\r\nWhile their debut, "People's Instinctive Travels And The Paths Of Rhythm", was more eclectic, and even self-consciously jokey, "The Low-End Theory" (recorded as a trio following the departure of Jarobi) saw them return to their roots with a more bracing, harder funk sound. \r\n\r\nThey were helped considerably by jazz bass player [a=Ron Carter] (who had worked with [a=Miles Davis] and [a=John Coltrane]), whose contribution rather dominated proceedings. Tracks such as "The Infamous Date Rape" stoked controversy, while samples from [a=Lou Reed], [a=Stevie Wonder] and [a=Earth, Wind & Fire] were used in a frugal and intelligent manner. By "Midnight Marauders" there were allusions to the rise of gangsta rap, although they maintained the optimism predominant on their debut. Q-Tip appeared in the 1993 movie "Poetic Justice" opposite [a=Janet Jackson], and helped to produce [a=Tony! Toni! Toné!] (whose Raphael Wiggins made an appearance on "Midnight Marauders"), [a=Nas], [a=Shyheim] and labelmate [a=Shaquille O'Neal]. \r\n\r\nThey were rewarded with the Group Of The Year category at the inaugural Source Magazine Hip Hop Award Show in 1994, before being pulled off the stage by the arrival of 2Pac and his Thug Life crew, attempting to steal some publicity. Two years elapsed before "Beats, Rhymes And Life" debuted at number 1 on the Billboard album chart. Their lyrics on this album were highly evolved, addressing issues with greater philosophy than the crude banter of their past recordings. Q-Tip's conversion to the Islamic faith in the mid-1990's may have had some bearing on this style. \r\n\r\n"The Love Movement", which debuted at US number 3 in October 1998, was another mature, stylish collection of material that lacked the spark of their earlier work.  ATCQ released "We Got It From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service" on November 4, 2016, nearly 18 years after their last album.  In the midst of record verses for the album as well as verses for his solo album, Phife Dawg passed away on March 22, 2016. During its first month of release, the album was greeted with both critical acclaim and fan support.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:03:52.332875	2017-11-23 19:03:52.332875	2

The most commercially successful artists of the 1970s, their biggest hits include Dancing Queen, Fernando, Waterloo, Chiquitita, Mamma Mia, and Take A Chance On Me. Sales figures for the group are widely varying, with the official estimate at 370 million records.\r\n\r\nTheir music has seen a resurgence in interest in part due to the release of their multi-platinum greatest hits album "ABBA Gold" in 1992 and a general revival in interest in disco and '70s music around the same time. Their music gained even greater visibility with the jukebox musical "Mamma Mia!" based on their hits, which opened in 1999 and is still running in venues around the world.\r\n\r\nABBA were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2010 in the category of performer.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:05:12.337854	2017-11-23 19:05:12.337854	17
80	Linkin Park	Alternative Rock / Modern Rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996.\r\n\r\nLinkin Park are one of the most popular bands of the so called "nü-metal" movement, along with [a108722], [a18837] and several others. Their sound is a wide range of influences, including metal, alternate rock, hip-hop, electronica and industrial. Linkin Park's debut album "[[m=74519]]" was a multi-platinum smash worldwide, selling over 13 million copies, 8 million of them in the US alone. [m=61489] is the correspondent remix album.\r\n\r\nOriginally named [a1118966], the band changed its name to [a901845]. However, this name caused a legal dispute when [a=Hybrid], a popular House music group, threatened to sue Hybrid Theory if the name was not changed. Searching for a new name, [a241527] was driving along when he saw a street sign for the park named "Lincoln Park" in Los Angeles. Originally, the band members wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com".\r\n\r\nFrontman Chester Bennington committed suicide on July 20, 2017.	2017-11-23 19:25:27.342102	2017-11-23 19:25:27.342102	25
67	Bee Gees	A singing trio of brothers — [a151481], [a179142], and [a290019]. They were born on the Isle Of Man to English parents, lived in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England, UK and during their childhood years moved to Brisbane, Australia, where they began their musical careers. Their worldwide success came when they returned to the UK and signed with producer [a272144]. \r\n\r\nThe multiple award-winning group was successful for most of its forty years of recording music, but it had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a harmonic 'soft rock' act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as the foremost stars of the disco music era in the late 1970s. \r\n\r\nNo matter the style, the Bee Gees sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognizable; as brothers, their voices blended perfectly, in the same way that The Everly Brothers and Beach Boys did. Barry sang lead on many songs, in an R&B falsetto introduced in the disco years; Robin provided the clear vibrato lead that was a hallmark of their pre-disco music; Maurice sang high and low harmonies throughout their career. The three brothers co-wrote most of their hits, and they said that they felt like they became 'one person' when they were writing. \r\n\r\nIn 1994 [a746270] were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1997 the Band was inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (Performer).\r\n\r\nThey were all given CBE's (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2001-2002 New Year's Honours List. The group's name was retired by the remaining brothers after Maurice died in January 2003.\r\n\r\nHowever, as time passed, they decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until brother Robin Gibb died in May 2012.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:05:25.332073	2017-11-23 19:05:25.332073	17

76	Radiohead	Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) band from Oxfordshire, England (United Kingdom).\r\n\r\nThe name Radiohead comes from the [a=Talking Heads] song, "Radio Head", from the "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Talking-Heads-True-Stories/master/39386]True Stories[/url]" album. \r\n\r\nFormed by school friends in 1986, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's "[r=767600]". The cathartic "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Creep/master/21481]Creep[/url]", from the debut album "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Pablo-Honey/master/13344]Pablo Honey[/url]" (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves. \r\n\r\nRadiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]" (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]'s expressive singing. The album featured the hits "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High & Dry[/url]", "[r=1463625]" and "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]". \r\n\r\nThe band's third album, "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]" (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990's, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]" (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.\r\n\r\n"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Hail-To-The-Thief/master/16962]Hail To The Thief[/url]" (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released "[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]" (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  "[url=https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/master/998252]A Moon Shaped Pool[/url]", was released in May 2016.\r\n \r\nRadiohead's original influences were cited as alternative rock and post-punk bands like [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Smiths,+The]The Smiths[/url], [a=Pixies], [a=Magazine], [a=Joy Division], and [a=R.E.M.] (with lead singer of the band, Thom Yorke, refering to himself as an 'R.E.M. groupie').	2017-11-23 19:22:36.349697	2017-11-23 19:22:36.349697	24

Mark Stoermer (bass, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) would complete the current line-up of the band in 2002. The band originated in Las Vegas, Nevada.

79	Nirvana	Alternative Rock (Modern Rock) band from Aberdeen, Washington (USA).\r\n\r\nNirvana formed in 1987. Considered by many to be the leading lights of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 1980s/early 1990s, and perhaps the most influential rock band of Generations X & Y, Nirvana was a powerful trio of musicians who brought a unique aesthetic to a growing-stale rock scene.  They had already made some waves on Sub Pop with their debut, "[m=13773]".  But it wasn't until their major-label debut for [l=DGC]/[l=Geffen Records], 1991's "[m=13814]" - perhaps, more specifically, the first 30 seconds of "[m=22439]" - that they broke into the mainstream of America - not really because they wanted to. Lead singer frontman [a=Kurt Cobain]'s death (suspected suicide) in April 1994 brought an untimely end to the band. Drummer [a=Dave Grohl] went on to form the [a=Foo Fighters].  In the fall of 2004, "[m=42482]" (a 3-CD/DVD set of mostly unreleased material) confirmed that interest in the band is still very high. Most young rock stars today will likely cite Nirvana as a major influence on them. Nirvana disbanded in 1994.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:25:15.455281	2017-11-23 19:25:15.455281	25

Their best-known and most stable lineup was Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson, in which configuration they became Motown's top act of the 1960s, though of that line-up only Wilson remained in the group by the time of the 1970s disco incarnation represented here. \r\n\r\nThe Supremes changed name in early 1967 to Diana Ross & The Supremes. Motown president [a=Berry Gordy] stated that the name change was done so that Motown could demand more money from live bookings, but rumors began to spread of an approaching Diana Ross solo career. \r\n\r\nAt that time member Florence Ballard had begun drinking and occasionally missing performance and, by June 1967, was replaced by Cindy Birdsong, a member of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Patti+LaBelle+And+The+Bluebells]Patti LaBelle & The Blue Belles[/url]. \r\n\r\nIn January 1970, Diana Ross & The Supremes gave their final performance and Ross began her solo career. Jean Terrell replaced Diana as the lead singer and thereby renaming the group back to The Supremes. \r\n\r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 (Performer). 	2017-11-23 19:29:13.362708	2017-11-23 19:29:13.362708	12

87	The Isley Brothers	American R&B/soul group from Cincinnati, Ohio, established in the early 1950s. O’Kelly Isley, Rudolph Isley, Ronald Isley and Vernon Isley (died 1956 in automobile accident) comprised the original group. They released their early hit “Shout!” in 1959. In 1963 they started own label T-Neck, and added a young [a=Jimi Hendrix] on lead guitar. In 1965 they signed on to Motown where they recorded “This Old Heart Of Mine”. They left Motown in 1968 and re-launched the T-Neck label in 1969 when they released  “It's Your Thing”. In 1973 they added the younger brothers Ernie and Marvin Isley, as well as O’Kelly's brother-in-law Chris Jasper to their regular lineup. During this era from 1973 to 1983 the group continued to release hits like “Between the Sheets”, “Choosey Lover” or “For the Love Of You”. \r\nInducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 (Performer). 	2017-11-23 19:29:47.349154	2017-11-23 19:29:47.349154	12
98	The Tornados	 English instrumental group mostly active in the 1960's.\r\n\r\nThe house band for pioneering record producer [a=Joe Meek]. Their original and classic line-up comprised [a=Alan Caddy] (guitar), [a=Clem Cattini] (drums), [a=Heinz] Burt (bass), [a=George Bellamy] (rhythm guitar) and [a=Roger LaVern] (keyboards). Their instrumental material was composed and produced by Meek, and frequently had a futuristic sound which reflected Meek's interest in electronics and sound manipulation. Although their first single "Love And Fury" bombed, the follow-up "[r=1240431]" caught the public imagination and was a number one hit in both the UK and USA (they were the first British group ever to top the US Hot Hundred). The quintet enjoyed several more UK hits, though the original line-up began to fall apart when Heinz Burt left for a solo career as a vocalist in 1963 (he scored one major UK hit, "Just Like Eddie" later that year), and none of the original members remained by the time the Tornados finally disbanded upon Meek's death in 1967.\r\n\r\nDo not confuse with american surf rock band [a252795], famous for the track "Bustin' Surfboards".	2017-11-23 19:41:32.351779	2017-11-23 19:41:32.351779	18

89	Gorillaz	Virtual band founded in 1998 by [a=Damon Albarn] from [a=Blur], and comic-book artist [a=Jamie Hewlett] designing and drawing the band. It can be found in [i]The Guiness Book of World Records[/I] under Most Successful Virtual Band. When the band were first created in 1998, the original concept was a group named 'Gorilla', with a slightly different lineup.\r\n\r\nThe lineup of characters is:\r\n[a=2D (3)] - Lead singer, keyboards, additional instruments. Gained his nickname from injuries he sustained in a car accident (vocals performed by [a=Damon Albarn]).\r\n[a=Murdoc Niccals] - Bassist, additional instruments.

An American expatriate, possessed by the ghosts of his late friends.\r\n\r\nFormer members:\r\nDel The Ghost Rapper - Rapper. One of the above friends, he was sent to the afterlife by the Grim Reaper following their first album (vocals performed by [a=Del Tha Funkee Homosapien]).\r\nPaula Cracker - Guitarist. 2D's girlfriend of two months, she was kicked out of the band for having an affair with Murdoc. She was a part of the band when they were known as 'Gorilla'.\r\nCyborg Noodle - Guitarist.

91	The Prodigy	British electronic group, founded in 1990. Their first release was single "What Evil Lurks" (1991). Their early music was mostly rave/breakbeat, but has become more mainstream mixing in rock guitars with the third album "The Fat Of The Land" (1997). \r\n\r\nBand members: \r\n- [a=Liam Howlett] (head of the group; producer). \r\n- [a=Keith Flint] (vocals, dancing). \r\n- [a=Maxim] (MCing, vocals). \r\n(- [a=Leeroy Thornhill] (dancing) – former longterm member). \r\n\r\nThe original Prodigy line-up was Liam on keyboards and Leeroy, Keith and Sharky as dancers. Maxim was recruited at short notice to MC at their debut gig at Labrynth in Dalston, London. Sharky left the group at Christmas 1990 after they got their record deal with XL as she didn't want to devote more time to the band. Their initial deal with XL was for 4 singles, with XL paying a £1500 advance prior to the first single. \r\n\r\nThe Prodigy briefly used the pseudonym [a=Earthbound (6)] (named after Liam's studio) for the original white-label summer releases of "One Love" (1993). [a=Leeroy Thornhill] left the band in 2000. 	2017-11-23 19:33:25.354505	2017-11-23 19:33:25.354505	5
92	Pet Shop Boys	Pet Shop Boys are an English musical duo, formed in London in 1981 and consisting of Neil Tennant (main vocals, keyboards, occasional guitar) and Chris Lowe (keyboards, occasional vocals). They are listed as the most successful duo in UK music history by The Guinness Book of Records. \r\nIn the early 90s they ran [l=Spaghetti Recordings] and more recently, [l=Olde English] and [l=Lucky Kunst] labels. \r\nIn March 2013, the duo officially left [l=Parlophone] after 28 years and entered into a new arrangement with [l=Kobalt Label Services] for their 12th studio album which would be the band's first release on their own music imprint [l=x2 (2)].	2017-11-23 19:33:37.352477	2017-11-23 19:33:37.352477	5
93	The Chemical Brothers	Tom & Ed met in history class at Manchester University in 1988. They started off as DJs known as "The 237 Turbo Nutters" (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn raving days). They then opted for "The Dust Brothers" which they nicked from the L.A. producers of "Pauls Boutique" (as they thought they would never be famous). In 1995 they changed their name to "The Chemical Brothers" after the real Dust Brothers threatened to sue.	2017-11-23 19:33:48.34683	2017-11-23 19:33:48.34683	5
94	The Mothers	The Mothers or [b]The Mothers Of Invention[/b].\r\n[a=Frank Zappa] teamed with gigging R&B group 'The Soul Giants' in 1964. The band included vocalist [a=Ray Collins], bassist [a=Roy Estrada] and drummer [a=Jimmy Carl Black]. Zappa emerged as their creative leader and the band became 'The Mothers' (as in mother-f**kers = good musicians). After signing to [l=Verve Records] this was appended to 'The Mothers Of Invention' at the insistence of the label. Until Zappa founded his own label the appendage was usually added in mock deference and the band were usually referred to as 'The Mothers'.\r\n\r\nGuitarist [a=Elliot Ingber] then joined and, for much of their seminal 1960's albums, the group also included woodwind player [a=Bunk Gardner], saxophonist [a=Motorhead Sherwood], keyboardist [a=Don Preston], multi-instrumentalist [a=Ian Underwood] and additional drummers [a=Billy Mundi] and [a=Art Tripp]. Most of these artists appeared on "Freak Out!" (1966), "Absolutely Free" and "We're Only In It For The Money" (1967), "Cruising With Ruben & the Jets" (1968) and "Uncle Meat" (1969).\r\nDuring Zappa's jazz/classical rock period of 1969-1970, his works were augmented by violinists [a=Don "Sugarcane" Harris] and [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], percussionist [a=Ruth Underwood] and drummers [a=Aynsley Dunbar] and [a=John Guerin]. Most of these artists appeared on "Uncle Meat", "Hot Rats", "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" and "Burnt Weeny Sandwich". \r\n\r\nFrom 1970-72, Zappa formed a new line-up with former [a48408] members [a=Flo & Eddie] and bassist [a=Jim Pons]. Preston, Underwood and Dunbar remained in the line-up, along with additional keyboardist [a=George Duke]. This line-up was disbanded, after Zappa was pushed from the stage by a fan in 1972. (He could not tour for the next year). Two more jazz rock albums, "Waka Jawaka" and "The Grand Wazoo", were recorded with much of the previous jazz-rock group including Preston, Ian and Ruth Underwood, Dunbar, Ponty, Huerin and Duke. Trumpeter [a=Sal Marquez] was also added. Zappa and the band went back to vocal rock songs with jazz elements in 1973 on "Over-Nite Sensation", then 1974's "Apostrophe" and 1975's "One Size Fits All". Much of the same band remained, along with new members [a=Bruce Lambourne Fowler] (trombone), [a=Tom Fowler] (bass) and [a=Napoleon M. Brock] (saxophone). In 1975 Zappa called a halt to this backing band. By the late '70s an entirely new support band was formed, with only occasional participation from past members, including a re-appearance of [a=Captain Beefheart]. Beginning in the 80's, past 'Mothers' members Collins, Black, Gardner, Sherwood, Preston, Tom and Bruce Fowler occasionally played in a mock Zappa band, 'The Grandmothers'. In 1985 Zappa adroitly used 'The Mothers Of Prevention' in his assault on American censorship aspects of the music industry.\r\n	2017-11-23 19:40:46.352702	2017-11-23 19:40:46.352702	18
95	Mahavishnu Orchestra	One of the premiere fusion groups, the [b]Mahavishnu Orchestra[/b] was considered by most observers during its prime to be a rock band, but its sophisticated improvisations actually put its high-powered music between rock and jazz. Founder and leader [a=John McLaughlin] had recently played with [a=Miles Davis] and Tony Williams' Lifetime. The original lineup of the group was McLaughlin on electric guitar, violinist [a=Jerry Goodman], keyboardist [a=Jan Hammer], electric bassist [a=Rick Laird], and drummer [a=Billy Cobham]. They recorded three intense albums for [l=Columbia Records] during 1971-1973 and then the personnel changed completely for the second version of the group. In addition to McLaughlin, the 1974 incarnation of the band consisted of violinist [a=Jean-Luc Ponty], [a=Gayle Moran] on keyboards and vocals, electric bassist [a=Ralphe Armstrong], and drummer [a=Narada Michael Walden]; by 1975 [a=Stu Goldberg] had replaced Moran and Ponty had left. John McLaughlin's dual interests in Eastern religion and playing acoustic guitar resulted in the band breaking up in 1975. Surprisingly, an attempt to revive the [b]Mahavishnu Orchestra[/b] in 1984 (using Cobham, saxophonist Bill Evans, keyboardist [a=Mitchel Forman], electric bassist [a=Jonas Hellborg], and percussionist [a=Danny Gottlieb]) was unsuccessful; one [l=Warner Bros. Records, Inc.] album resulted. However, when one thinks of the [b]Mahavishnu Orchestra[/b], it is of the original lineup, which was very influential throughout the 1970s.	2017-11-23 19:40:58.350943	2017-11-23 19:40:58.350943	18
96	Tangerine Dream	Founded by the late [a=Edgar Froese], Tangerine Dream is perhaps the premier exponent of "electronic rock" music of the "Berlin School". From their "free-rock" beginnings in the nascent "krautrock" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to [l=Virgin], this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer/sequenced electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - the Dream's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional "rock" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.\r\n\r\nFormed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included [a=Edgar Froese], [a=Conrad Schnitzler] (cello) and [a=Klaus Schulze] (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the "krautrock" twist. [i]Electronic Meditation[/i] is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and "freak out jamming" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming [a=Ash Ra Tempel] and going on to become the other major proponent of the "Berlin School". Second album, [i]Alpha Centauri[/i], saw the addition of long-standing member [a=Christopher Franke] replacing Schulze, while [a=Peter Baumann] would come aboard for [i]Zeit[/i]. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, [i]Green Desert[/i] was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release [i]Phaedra[/i] would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. [a=Michael Hoenig] temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was [i]Sorcerer[/i], a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on [i]Cyclone[/i], which saw the addition of [a=Steve Jolliffe], adding vocals and woodwinds and [a=Klaus Krüger] on drums. [i]Force Majeure[/i] was the classic of this period. [a=Johannes Schmölling] would join for [i]Tangram[/i]. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief stint with [l=Jive Records] from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's [l=Private Music] label and then the equally New Agey [l=Miramar], fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. [a=Paul Haslinger] replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese's son [a=Jerome Froese] in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese's own [l=TDI Music] label (later renamed [l=Eastgate]), TD's reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate - father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories - but the group's artist direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese's death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members. \r\n	2017-11-23 19:41:08.364628	2017-11-23 19:41:08.364628	18
99	Depeche Mode	English electronic music band formed March 1980 in Basildon, Essex, and named after a popular French fashion magazine. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards), and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981). Depeche Mode released their debut record in 1981, Speak & Spell, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record A Broken Frame, released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years.\r\n\r\nThe band's last albums of the 1980s, Black Celebration and Music for the Masses, established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released Violator, a mainstream success. The subsequent album, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and the supporting Devotional Tour exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released Ultra in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Gore's alcoholism and seizures and Fletcher's depression. The release of Exciter confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, Exciter Tour being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the Devotional Tour, although the band had toured in 1998 to support The Singles 86–98 compilation album.\r\n\r\nDepeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have to this day sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the world's best-selling music artists in the world. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode "the most popular electronic band the world has ever known" and included the band in the list of the "50 Bands That Changed the World!". Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists Of All Time.\r\n\r\nCurrent lineup:\r\n[a=Martin L.

100	Kraftwerk	Krautrock > electronic experimental > electro-pop band from Düsseldorf, Germany, formed in 1970.\r\n\r\nFormerly known as [a=Organisation], Kraftwerk debuted live as the trio of Ralf Hütter, Florian Schneider-Esleben and Charly Weiss at the Tivoli Popfestival, Aachen on 11 July 1970. Klaus Dinger took over as drummer after that. Gigs between 26 December 1970 and 30 July 1971 omitted Hutter, with various line-ups including Michael Rother and others. Dinger & Rother then split-off forming [a=Neu!].
